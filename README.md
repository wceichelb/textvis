vis is an exploratory rails app that exists primarily because i don't really
understand qualitative analysis. i happen to have a whole lot of text to make
sense of, so i feel that some text visualization is in order.

### TODO

- [ ] sentiment analysis with [ textblob ]( https://textblob.readthedocs.org/en/latest/quickstart.html#quickstart )
