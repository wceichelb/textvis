,"This instructor presented a lot of ""facts"" (i.e. this deficiency is associated with this finding) and gave very little explanation of the physiology behind these findings. This gave me no conceptual framework to work with. When she was asked about physiology, she did not seem to know many of the answers.",

"Really liked the exercise that Dr. Nelsen prepared for us and the try at active learning -- I think it was a big success despite some of the handout adjustments, technical difficulties, and time limits. It was useful to draw out the pathways by hand in different colors and in comparing what we had learned before (i.e., somatic innervation) vs. visceral invitation.",,
"Dr. Habeckers handouts are great active learning tools.","Dr. Habeckers slides were confusing at times -- her continued narrative around her editing process for the slides was distracting this particular session. I felt like the drug list provided by Dr. Habecker was low yield and somewhat overwhelming -- Dr. Olyaeis drug tables are a great way to structure information with key information highlighted -- the tables really help students understand differences and similarities between drugs.",

"Great lecture and lecturer, enjoyed the tilt table and the flow diagrams along with the solicitation of student ideas around what causes differences in the baroreflex.","Perhaps this is just me, but I typically like to hear key concepts repeated over and over again and the concepts fleshed out during the middle of the lecture and then consolidated at the end to help me synthesize the broad concepts. Dr. McCully did a great job of this with baroreflex, but emphasis and reemphasis of key RAAS concepts would have been helpful in drilling down the concepts.",

"Dr. Nelsen is great! She is one of my favorite instructors. I found the reading to be very helpful. Unfortunately I did not do it until after class, because most professors assign to much reading and so I have stopped doing it altogether. I think I would have gotten more out of the lecture if I had done the reading.","The worksheets were a tad bit confusing. I used this website from University of Michigan as a supplement and found it very helpful: http://www.med.umich.edu/lrc/coursepages/m1/anatomy2010/html/courseinfo/module_index.html. Perhaps next years students would enjoy it as well.","I do not understand why Dr. Camerons lectures wasnt one of the first ones given this week. The organization of this curriculum baffles me at times. Also there were about ten different tables used to describe the various adrenergic receptors. It would be helpful if these were combined into a more succinct table."
,"This was not a good format for teaching us pharmacology. It is very frustruating when I show up for class, only to be asked to teach myself. I would much rather do this on my own time and in my own way rather than sitting in groups and looking up drugs on Wikipedia. Please do not repeat this format.",

,"I do not know why we did not discuss nutrition that is relevant to the heart, considering the week was focused on cardiology. I know that she probably was assigned the topics she was supposed to cover, and that it probably is not her fault. Again, the organization of the block baffles me.",
"The group activities and team learning are a waste of time - instead of having us fill out worksheets just provide all of the materials ahead of time completely filled in and then let us just memorize it.  This is a much better use of our time.","The group activity and time spent filling our worksheets was a waste of time and I didnt get anything out of it.  I had to go relearn everything on my own.  Just give us the material and lecture, make it simple for us.",
"I like the way that we are learning to write problem representations, but I find doing it as a group to be less helpful. Usually the outspoken people just take charge and there is very little actual learning by the remainder of the group. It would be more helpful to submit them individually as part of the irat and then have the best ones read aloud by the instructor to the class. Just a thought.","I like the concept of problem representations. I still find the iRAT questions to be bizarre and generally a waste of time. There is no reason to spend an hour going over three questions. I would rather just be taught the information. (Additionally, the pre-reading materials often fail to address the actual questions and require substantial outside research).","This week is not off to a good start. In what world do you start a cardiovascular, pulmonary and renal block without covering basic anatomy of these structures in the first lecture. I do not understand how it could be so difficult to grasp the concept of progressive teaching - start with basics and gradually progress to more complex topics. Instead, we start with complex topics and regress. So grateful that my undergraduate institution had an excellent A&P program - otherwise I would be totally lost right now. I truly pity my fellow classmates. <br>Side note: I apologize for any ranting I may do this term. I have, in the past, deferred from commenting on these evaluations, as I prefer not to dwell on the negative aspects of this curriculum. However, in light of recent threats of professional forms, I have been forced to narrate my inner thoughts here."
"Clear, concise and well organized. Dr. Nelsen is a wonderful teacher.",none,
"challenges the students","give more introduction to drugs and basic physiology first before taking it a step further and testing our knowledge. it is very hard to keep all the drugs straight when we didnt have a basic introduction.","i felt like this session was not very effective because of the lack of basic knowledge."

"Excellent instruction on this topic. For this particular lecture, it was highly effective to have us watch a pre-recorded lecture and then draw out the pathways to understand their differences. I think there was some confusion as to what was being asked initially. Perhaps, it would be helpful to go through one example of a pathway with us on the document camera and then we can walk through the other three in our groups in class. Overall, the interactive component and organization were very well done.",,

"clear and concise. i loved that his general overview was actually a general overview and he did not present us with excessive details. his presentation was very easy to pay attention to.",,
,"I would have appreciated a study guide to review more of the information before class.  Ideally this would be similar to the one that Dr. Chien provided.",
,,
"Your study guide and handout were helpful but I think where the instruction was lacking most was in 1) your speed and 2) your explanations of how you had changed things. I appreciate your effort and time spent on creating this lecture, but the organization was quite difficult to wrap my head around. Perhaps a slide at the beginning quickly referencing the outline of the lecture. As I was reviewing lecture material and using outside resources (namely Youtube), I found it most helpful to think of the receptor categories (briefly) and then explain some of the drugs (pick the top 3 for example). If we understand how those work, then we can much more easily figure out the effect and other similar or antagonistic drugs. Use hypertension or hypotension as great starting points for cases. I think it would also be helpful to speak somewhat faster during lecture.",,
"I enjoyed your lecture and how you incorporated humor. One complaint I have is in noticing terms and concepts in the objectives which were not even touched on in lecture. If there is something you would like us to get outside of lecture, please make a note of these explicitly (although of course, we dont want to have to read extra to learn something not taught in lecture). It made things somewhat more confusing during study time when we realized there were several more objectives than were covered in class.",,
"Having the ability to speed up the lectures and still see the image was great! Similarly, it was very helpful that you created the narrative on slide box including links to the annotations. Very clear. Thank you for having all the faculty available for questions as well.",,
"Materials were great.  Slides are concise with clear information","Order of material presented could be improved.  we should first go over the basics of what is the sympathetic chain?? then discuss how depending on what youre innervating, the way the nerves get there is different.  then go through the worksheets in order to compare and contrast each one.  then watch the video (since it was extremely dense and synthesized the material).<br><br>I came to class hoping to have the video explained since I didnt understand it whatsoever, and instead we were told to work on the worksheets--which I had no idea how to fill out because I didnt understand the video.  In a flipped classroom, we watch a short video that explains a key concept, then we go over it in class to check for understanding.  We didnt do that--we just further exasperated our misunderstanding by working on the worksheets.  This was a challenging concept that I think should be presented differently in the future in order to optimize student understanding of the material.","These slides/video should have been posted sooner."
"Thank you for teaching our class. Your enthusiasm was completely apparent and appreciated. You did a great job of explaining the baroreflex. As I scroll back through my notes, I feel like a got a strong understanding of the baroreflex from your lecture, including its relation to pathologies like obesity. I liked how you took the time to do the tilt table experiment but given that there wasnt a pronounced change in either US or the HR, it wasnt very clear what we were observing. I understood the concept after you debriefed it but perhaps a conversation could occur before the experiment to discuss what we expect to happen and then be looking for that in particular. The time that we took to talk with our peers about the different cases or questions you presented was also great. One difficulty I had with your lecture was with the RAAS system portion. It seemed very surface level and I think we are expected to know more detail than what was explained for our Step 1 exam. RAAS by itself could have been a whole lecture so perhaps one solution would be to assign the Khan academy videos on RAAS, telling us which one or two videos you want us to watch. Otherwise, I thought you did an excellent job!",,

"Appreciated the study guide, but it would be nice to have more information in one place (instead of a study guide and drug sheet as different documents).","I liked the discussion on the drugs but would have appreciated more discussion on the general function of the receptors (Alpha-2 = self regulation receptor?).   I liked the discussion on the drugs but would have appreciated more discussion on the general function of the receptors (Alpha-2 = self regulation receptor?) to maintain homeostasis rather than as pharmacological targets.",

"very knowledgeable","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHc8-rzRRHM#t=19<br>I added this link because its 1 set of videos on this pharmacology that I found really helpful.

"A lot of useful information","So many different types of resources--you have to search many different documents to find an answer.  It would be helpful if the professor could make the information more concise--for example her charts were wonderful.  If more charts were utilized instead of only just having paragraph form description of drugs, it would make it easier for students to compare/contrast these drugs. Also, the last chart regarding atropine was never discussed in class.  That chart was extremely important to know for the test and we spent zero time on it in class.  We had three hours of class and the time was not used efficiently.  In the future, it would greatly benefit students to efficiently use the time to cover topics the instructor finds essential and foundational; it would also be useful to discuss the drugs in class.",
"Clear lecture.","Topics seemed all over the place--next time it would be helpful if there was a more clear topic/objective.",
"Online lecture was good. Annotations were good.","Time was not used wisely in class.  This is out only alotted histology time and the instructors thought it would be a good idea to crash SlideBox at the beginning of it.  Many students were unable to log on to SlideBox and participate in class.  These students like valuable time with pathologists who could help answer their questions.  Furthermore, many objectives were not mentioned in the online lecture.  It would be helpful if the information for the objectives werent in so many places--it feels like the instructors are cramming in all of these different concepts and telling students to go learn it on their own, then when students come to class your main resource for asking questions (SlideBox) will be shut down.",

"Princess of the Bride was weaved in which was engaging.  Information was organized and clearly presented.","Post slides before class, ideally by the Friday before your class.  Create a separate document containing the slides with the answers and post those after the lecture.",
,"Dr. Habecker posted revised answers to iRAT questions in her lecture slides.  These answers do not match what is posted under the iRAT section.  This can lead to students thinking that the iRAT slides are factually correct, when actually some of the information has been changed according to Dr. Habeckers slides.  Instructors should coordinate their responses to ensure the most accurate information is given to students & that information is consistent throughout the material.",
,"Really had a hard time with the active learning activity, even having watched the video just the night before. The video itself was very challenging to follow as a first pass through the material, and then the exercise in class expected us to regurgitate that. Unfortunately, I think it was an extremely poor use of time, but it could be vastly improved in a couple ways. One way would be to have a more basic into video to get our feet on the ground. A second thing would be to have more instruction at the beginning of class to build on the basics from the video. After that, the active learning exercise would have worked as designed. However, as it was presented, the pre work video was better used as final review.","Really unclear how Dr. Nelsens lecture fit as the first lecture of our block, and how it fits into everything else. Seems like we dove straight into very detailed stuff without learning the big picture first."
"Really fantastic use of clicker questions in the last half of her presentation. I cant say enough about that. It was great to spend time and discuss them, think through the physiology, etc. She did one of the next examples of these in depth clicker questions we have had so far and it was very effective for helping me reason through the physiology.","Unfortunately, i didnt find the worksheets at the beginning to be a good active learning exercise. Simply looking things up is something we can do at home and discourages those of us who show up. I think it would have been better to have that material presented traditionally, and then use those charts to work more with reasoning through the physiology in an active manner like we did later on in her presentation.<br>Additionally, it seemed like there were a lot of inconsistencies in terms of what drugs were involved between the worksheet, drug list, the study guide, and the lecture. Specifically, drugs which appeared on the worksheet were nowhere in the slides or drug list. This made it more difficult to figure out specifically what drugs we were responsible for being familiar with.",
,,
"Great format as always. Really helpful to have the stuff already annotated in slidebox. Also nice to have multiple people circulating.","Unfortunately my connection to slidebox was crippled completely for the rest of the session after we tried to crash the server. Maybe this would have been better to do near the end of the session, since I wasnt able to get nearly as much out of this session due to computer issues as I was the first session.",
"Really nice clear diagrams and graphics on the slides. Also did a good job of incorporating the previous lectures concept slide. Did a good job of explaining the concepts clearly.","Didnt find the active learning exercises to be particularly useful. It seemed as though they were very open ended with no right answers. This could be improved if she refocused us and put us on the right track at the end. However, as it happened, we seemed to just listen to speculative comments from our classmates but didnt actually learn the correct information very well.",

,"This lecture was effective although it felt a bit disorganized. I would like to bring up one of the comments Dr. Moulton made during lecture. He made a joke about lynching which was not intended to be malicious but lynching is a racially and historically charged word and can be very triggering.

For example, we were just told to not put the patients age at the beginning but instead at the end. Since this part of the curriculum is ""evidence-based"" Im wondering the reason for this change. Does the research suggest one way or another? Have recent articles come out suggesting a change? Whats the basis for doing this? In future sessions I would like more clarification on the research behind this part of our curriculum because I think everyone in our class is confused and getting more confused each time the instructions change. I am a huge proponent of basing our curriculum off of high quality social science and psychology research but--like we are encouraged to do with all research as medical students--I would become more familiar with the reasoning behind writing problem representations and summary statements.",

"Overall I think Dr. Nelsen is a great instructor, she does a good job of explaining material and preparing coursework.  I think she has done an excellent job with the limited time we have had for anatomy.","This week specifically the monday morning lecture felt poorly done.  Almost all of the class did the prework(including myself) and many watched the video multiple times.  It still felt like it needed more explanation and having us try draw out on the sheets and follow the drawings was difficult.  I think it was a good idea but dense material and we needed more lecture before trying to make our worksheets.","The above comments are more specific to this week."
"Dr. Habecker makes it clear what we need to know and understands her material very well.","I think this weeks lecture went very poorly for multiple reasons.  The biggest being that we basically started with a worksheet with no lecture.  I think active learning and working on worksheets like this can be useful but we need more direction and preparation.  Even with prework and reading it makes a huge difference for an instructor to spend a bit time of time teaching us before we try and reason it our ourselves.  With little to no lecture before trying to fill out a worksheet we were extremely inefficient.  I spent much of the class on wiki, up to date, books, and other resources just looking information up.  Why come to a lecture if I could just sit at home and look info up and have a similar experience?","Previous lectures have been better but my above comments are in regards to this weeks lecture."
"Dr. Moulton is very good at working with the students, understanding where we are coming from, and trying to help us.  I think he is good at speaking to the group and keeping the lecture engaging.","The biggest problem I found was that there was a massive list of objectives that we covered a small portion of.  This is fine if we dont actually need to know all of that but it felt unclear and it seemed like we touched on parts of some but never truly delved into them.  Lastly, this is not for this specific lecture but overall the lectures felt disconnected and in the overall idea of learning cardiac medicine im unsure how things connect.","Overall I really like Dr. Moulton and look forward to more lectures.  This week in general though felt like a very odd and scattered way to begin cardio."

A handout, a lecture study guide, a drug study guide, lecture slides, and the actual oral lecture plus answer keys are too many things to put together. I spent as much time as I did in her three-hour lecture or more just figuring out how to get all of those resources to line up with one another and make sense (while making my own consolidated study guide). Again, looking up drugs on Wikipedia is not why I come to class. If you want us to learn a list of drugs, give it to us and teach it (like Olyaei). I spent too much time in class this week online in ""active learning"" scavenger hunts. It takes 10 times more time than just hearing someone lecture about a drug and half the time the drug we found was not on the list of drugs to know.",

It is one of the only active learning sessions thats actually worked because there was a powerpoint we watched that we learned from before attending the class which made the active learning session effective, unlike some other active learning sessions weve had without any previous knowledge which makes them completely in-effective (Histology is an exception, because it always has lectures to watch beforehand and its great).","The exam-soft questions were a little confusing, so I think if we could have more time in lecture to go over things it would really help solidify things and clarify stuff. f",

It is not reasonable to ask us to go learn and memorize all of these drugs (which are really important) without first walking us through them.

Much of the information was difficult to find, and when all was said and done I felt like I needed to go back and re-teach all of the material to myself. Id say that presenting the essential information first (in the form of a lecture or something similar), and then allowing us to engage with the material with clicker questions or case examples would be helpful. I know that there was an attempt to do this with the USMLE questions, but the question became unmanageable when we had many drugs which were not covered as possible answers.",

"Set clear and reasonable expectations of what needed to be done before lecture, and had a clearly detailed understanding of the material.","Rather than having us all do the worksheets in groups, it would have simply been helpful to watch her, as the instructor explain and draw out the worksheets with us doing them with her, rather than doing it in a haphazard way ourselves. It also would have been helpful to have structures like ""brain stem"" etc on the worksheets to make completing them more feasible.",
"The worksheet have very targeted and specific information for us to complete and served as a good study tool once we had completed it. I also liked the practice questions we got at the end of lecture. It was helpful to see the different ways that the board questions can use the material.","Although I did not mind the order of the lecture material, it would be much easier to complete the worksheets after we had reviewed the information on the as a group. I find it very hard to gain knowledge form completing a worksheet when I am forced to sift through materials to find the answers, rather than after the information has been given and it is up to me to use that information and work with it to place it into a worksheet. In the future, I would suggest having specific worksheet portions be completed after the information on them has been covered, rather than before.",
"Was clearly knowledgeable about the material and what concepts needed to be prioritized.","In the future I would appreciate more written information explaining the pictures on the slides in the slide deck. Although the slides were clear, when I compared the objectives to the slides, it was difficult to determine where some information was supposed to be found because the lecture felt very general/surface level. It is also difficult to go back and absorb information form the lecture slides when there is little guiding information on the slides.",
"Good structure to the lecture time. I like the new structure of having to watch a lecture before hand, having some questions that test some of my understanding and then working on slidebox.","Since it is difficult to get through all of the slides during the time, it would be good to know which slides should be prioritized in terms of seeing important structures.",
"The graphics chosen for slides were clear and simple. The demonstration was helpful.","It would be nice to have new vocabulary explained during class. As the new curriculum is structured differently, it is best to assume we have no background knowledge on the topic and explain simple things--like what the structures in the brainstem actually are. In addition, the discussion questions presented were a bit too broad and nebulous. During lecture, I do not find it useful to try to guess at answers to questions about material that has not been presented. Typically this results in simply googling the information and guessing at what concept the lecturer is getting at. Conversely, it is much more helpful to do activities where we use the information that has just been given--either through mapping out the feedback loops or solving an example problem related to the material given.",
"Explanations of the nutritional disorders and what types of problems we would see in what places (Oregon or abroad) were clear and helpful. This was by far the best nutrition lecture we have had, both in terms of clarity and in terms of obvious application.","The organization of the lecture was a bit difficult to follow. Some of the slides seemed to jump around rather than staying in one type of micro nutrition class etc. It also probably would have been helpful to have a simple breakdown of the different types of nutritional disorders before we jumped into the specifics. Although I am aware of the differences between macro and micro-nutrition it was clear from the questions that many students in the class were not.",
"Engaging many students in the class and encouraging participation.","It would be nice if during the monday morning session we got more of a preview of the upcoming information rather than focusing so specifically on our cases. Typically the cases only apply to one or two lectures so although we get to know one patient, it would be nice if the morning session was better used to preview all of the weeks material rather than a small subset of it.",

Also, I think it would be a good idea for each student to do all 4 worksheets so we can reenforce each one.",
"Dr. Habecker is extremely smart and knowledgable about pharmacology. I also like that she gives us thoughtful worksheets to reenforce the learning material and also to challenge our thinking about concepts.","It would have been much more helpful for me to have a solid lecture before working on any worksheets or active learning materials. Without the background information, I feel like I am flailing and using a lot of Wikipedia to answer worksheet questions. My preference would be to have all of the lecture information given upfront and have the supplemental activities given afterwards.",

"The baroreceptor and RAAS pathway lecture was straightforward and informative. I was able to follow and understand the concepts. Lecture slides were reenforcing and served as a great study tool afterwards.","The only difficulty I had was following the deeper conceptual in-class questions. I would argue to complete the lecture first and save those questions for the end of the class. But it was helpful that you posted the answers to the questions that we were able to get off of sakai and study before the test.",

I had hoped Dr. Steckers lecture would talk more about the electrical conduction of the specific areas of the heart and the movement of the impulse during the cardiac cycle. When the objective summary was posted at the end of his session, it seemed like the 4 four points or so were not talked about very much and most of the lecture involved the last 2 points which concerned ECG business. I think most of the class would have liked more time with the conduction content, since EKGs were covered in more depth in a later session.",

"He did a decent job with his lecture, but it was too complex and the basics were not presented. In his defense, this was largely on the shoulders of the block directors/schedulers. Having a lecture on electrical conductance and EKG before even hearing about the cardiac cycle seems a bit unreasonable.",,"With regards to progression of presented materials, this block has not gotten off to a good start. It seems logical that we should have been presented with the fundamentals of cardiology before diving into pathologies, EKGs, excitation-contraction coupling, etc. We were presented with 6 days of cardiology before even hearing about the basic cardiac cycle. We have still not had lectures dedicated to fundamentals such as the Frank-Starling Curve and cardiac muscle. This is unfair to the lecturers who have come to teach us more advanced topics that we cannot yet wrap our heads around and more importantly, unfair to us. I have struggled these past two weeks to teach myself the fundamentals of cardiology so that I can begin to even understand the expectations of these more advanced topics.

"She did a great job on the embryology lectures. Very clear.","Please come up with a standardized method for listing structures on our anatomy exams - preferrably the accepted method (e.g. ""renal pelvis of the right kidney"") as this is what our attendings will use. It is very frustruating when some structures are listed in one way (organ first, then side citation, then structure) while other are listed in another (side citation, structure, parent organ). I studied exclusively off of the anatomy hive list, but I truly struggled finding the structures in the list on todays exam, even though I knew them in their correctly formated form. The actual structure should be listed first and then cited back to its organ. This would also make the exam more challenging because you have to actually know the structure - you arent just picking form a list of structures under ""Heart - ."" I am feeling frustruated with the grading system as well. I earned an A on the first Anatomy legitimately, while many others had elevated scores due to acceptance of multiple INCORRECT answers (three muscles of extensor compartment were accepted even though the tag was very clear). Now the format is flipped and I am having a hard time finding things in the list and am getting much worse scores. It is a frustruating feeling, as I do not wish to study incorrect anatomical citations on a list when there is so much clinically relevant anatomy/physiology to learn.",

Also, the lecture started giving the block directors feedback during the class; I think it would have been best to do this after class since the lecturer was already leaving early and the block directors work really hard and it didnt seem appropriate to call them out during class.

Professor needs to check in with students for their understanding and professor must break down the concepts--not skip over them and assume we already know them.","EKG science skills lab by Dr. Diller really broke down how to read EKGs and understand leads; that session should be before this one or it could be the sole EKG lecture since most of the students learned about EKGs through the tutorial and attending the EKG science skills session."

Also, there was not a lot of information on the defects; in the future it would be helpful to have the same slides and then maybe a study guide that just adds a little more information on the defects--its just that right now there are just the names of the defects and not much else that is available to us through this lecture.  I dont think a lot more information needs to be added, but a few facts about each one could be helpful in better understanding them.",

"I thought the play-doh was a good idea.","Because of how convoluted the embryological changes are, perhaps a ""before"" and ""after"" should be emphasized. Of course you can go through the intermediate steps in class, but from the looks of 1st Aid we should know what final structures are derived from what primitive structures. I also cant tell if the 6 arterial branches are needed for Step 1, so perhaps that part can be economized a bit. <br><br>Heres an example of what I mean by simplifying the ""before"" and ""after"":   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxPp67XluQA<br><br>The older youtube recording was a good assignment for pre-work.",

It is extremely tiring to try to focus on concepts like this without intermittent breaks for a clicker question or to chat with our neighbor about the material.",

When you cut out every surrounding structure how am I supposed to identify a given structure?  Why make anatomy more difficult than necessary, it was not like people were doing well in that course to begin with.  Furthermore, surgeons dont operate on patients missing major sections of every organ- they have the entire organ system to work with and help them identify structures.

,,"the word list for the anatomy practical seemed particularly confusing for this test. Fortunately, I was able to work around it as I studied the anatomy hive word list. I am wondering if in the future in anatomy, if the list of objective that we get to study from could be the same as the anatomy hive list? I understand that objectives are grouped by location (compartment, cavity, etc), but the words (ie the first letters) could maybe be the same? That way, we would know how to look up terms in the anatomy hive without needing to study the word list."

,,"The material:  It is interesting, I enjoy learning about it.<br>The Exam: <br>-I felt the questions about ECGs were completely unreasonable in that they required a level of knowledge far greater than would could have been acquired during the course of last week.  Moreover, we had one two-hour session on ECGs the day before the test, during which the professor had to alter his teaching plan to cover the fundamentals of reading an EKG because the majority of the class did not feel comfortable reading abnormal ECGs.  Despite this, we were asked the next day during the test to examine an abnormal ECG and identify it cause.  When I encountered those ECG questions on the test Friday, for the first time in medical school I felt completely dumbfounded- I had absolutely no idea where to begin to analyzing the ECG because the fundamental concepts of rate, rhythm, axis were not helpful in identifying the ECG.<br>-I was surprised at how little material about pressure-volume relationship and CO-venous return curves appeared on the exam<br><br>My health:  Its bad- every single week of medical school, I get 0-5 hours of sleep the night before the exam despite putting all of my energies into school during the week.  I dont have time to exercise or have a social life.  The weekend comes around and I am completely exhausted, but I have to study ahead for next week or else I know I wont have any time to sleep the night before the test.  I blame this lifestyle mostly on the curriculum design and partly on my ambitiousness.  The curriculum design is problematic for me because it requires me to attend class all day when I am a poor auditory learner.  I learn best through reading and for that reason I love it when professors post study guides.<br><br>Readings- how can we read ahead or do pre-readings when we are in class all day and have to go home and study what we learned in class?  There is no time to do additional readings when we have to learn what we are taught in class."

Still, I think the strength of this embryology in-class learning bit was that you gave the information we had to use right before you had us do it, so it was more of a reinforcement of what we learned.  Your week 1 was good too, but this one was a lot better because there was so little time between learning the material and then using it in an in-class activity, so there wasnt much time to forget.

,,"This isnt directly related to this week, but Im having a hard time learning in anatomy, and Im hoping that the situation can be improved. It is really hard to learn anatomy during labs when there are 15 students crowded around a single cadaver, and the same issue arises during faculty tutorial time. This isnt as much an issue for the structures that are easy to identify independently using a Netters app, but for the smaller structures that are hard to identify from a picture, its a real problem because I never end up seeing them and learning them in a cadaver.  (Even the students that have taken anatomy before often cant help teach this, because undergrad anatomy classes often dont go that much into depth.) If theres any way we could get more small group time, or more time focusing on the smaller structures (minor arteries, small nerves, etc.), that would be really helpful. <br><br>Somewhat related to this - in general, there are some structures that pointed out over and over again in anatomy, and there are some structures that are never or almost never shown. I know that there are too many structures to identify them all during a four hour class period, but its demoralizing when these structures arent shown on cadavers and then appear on a test. (For example, I only saw the thoracic cardiac nerves once, and not in our ""official"" anatomy lab - I had to specifically ask an instructor to point them out to me during a faculty lab period in order to see them at all.) I admittedly dont have any good ideas on how to rectify this, since I know there are time and space limitations, but it would be really helpful if there are any ways to address this."

"The slides are concise, well-annotated, and flow nicely.","Ive noticed over the course of Dr. Girauds lecture that he typically interrupts students when theyre asking questions, particularly when he believes he understands what students are asking before they state their actual question; additionally, Dr. Girauds body language and affect when students ask questions seems to de-legitimize students who do ask questions (even when germane to the topic and not covered further into the lecture). Please consider allowing students to complete their thought and then respond. Because many of us are learning the material for the first time, we might not have the correct understanding -- this is why many of us ask questions. Many instructors try to put themselves in our shoes when students ask questions and say, ""thats a great question,"" even when sometimes the questions are not great questions. I think many instructors realize how stressful it can be to ask a question in front of 100+ of your incredibly competent classmates and friends and want to not appear ""silly or stupid."" Encouraging students to ask questions and supporting them when they do would go a long way to helping Dr. Girauds sessions be more effective and be less hostile.",

Unfortunately, he seemed to dismiss side effects of medications which have been presented by other faculty and hyper-inflate the results of studies by using relative risk ratios (which seemed huge!), when absolute risk reductions were &lt;1%. The data he presented was biased, inflated, and grossly untrue. This lecture should be specifically addressed by block directors because fellow students without significant epidemiological training are confused about conflicting information and may be led down the wrong path by this ""expert.""",

He also openly chastised a student for asking a really relevant question that no one understood. He refused to answer the question and instead spent the time on a short rant about how we need to figure things out for ourselves.

For example, fish oil benefits were presented using relative risk values when the absolute risk values demonstrated minimal benefit. Furthermore, much of this data was in stark contrast to what a previous lecturer had said earlier in the day and what another lecturer said later in the week.

The lecture was easy to follow, but when it comes to devices, I really dont know what is relevant from my perspective and what is just extra information.",
"-knowledgeable<br>-insightful study guide","I have never seen an instructor so callously reject a students question before. It was a nuanced and thoughtful question too that was not covered but was important to facilitating comprehension. And I am still wondering the answer to it--how two drugs with seemingly opposing effects (prolonging AP duration and shortening it) can have the exact same effect on fixing arrhythmia. I understand not being able to answer questions due to a lack of time, but to dismiss them as basic and citing that ""you dont want to be paternalistic"" is demeaning to us as students.",

If it werent for the extra EKG review, I would still be struggling to understand even the most basic EKG findings (which I still struggle with). The pharmacology lectures were contradictory, and there seemed to be no order to how the material was presented. Unlike previous years, we will not be covering the heart in detail ever again in a classroom setting. The fact that this information was not taught properly now jeopardizes our future board scores and professional licenses and leaves us wide open to kill our future patients with our ignorance."

,"A 2 hour talk on statins and other lipid lowering agents and barely a mention of side effects or drug-drug interactions? This coupled with the extensive conflicts of interest and outdated studies (including one by the instructor himself) made this a very ineffective talk. Statins are an important topic in medicine and to get this talk from someone with such extensive ties to drug companies feels wrong. Additionally, very little time was spent discussing the pathophysiology of the drugs, instead defending the widespread use of statins for both primary and secondary prevention of MI. Finally, I was particularly taken aback by Dr. Duells answer to the question about myopathy as a side effect. He asked the class how many had had muscle aches in the past month and most raised their hands. ""Well, there you have it,"" he said. Is this the type of logic we want to have as future clinicians? I am appalled that Dr. Duell was allowed to lecture medical students on this topic.",

N/a,"The antiarrhythmic drug lecture was too much to digest, too fast.

It is impossible to write, type, or remember everything that is said by the lecturer. Also the study guide wasnt helpful because it wasnt concise and just brute memorizing tons of facts becomes counterproductive at some point. This lecture needs to be reworked so it is more digestible and needs to focus on less things, but these will be things we remember. As of now I cant say much about these drugs even after spending the most time time trying to learn them. Also the question asked in question about why there was different responses to the block of sodium channels was a legitimate question and it should have been answered.","The antiarrhythmic drug lecture was too much to digest, too fast.

,"lectures in an organized sequential fashion are very helpful. Also, ""need to know"" base lecture is most. There was a lot of extra information, that just muddies up and distracts me from learning the basic concepts (which are most essential to learn anything else!).","Im still a little butt-hurt that he snapped at a student for asking a valid question, and responded with ""you should have already learned that"". I felt really bad for him.  We are learning things for the first time on an accelerated schedule, and unfortunately we dont have the luxury of learning every single low-yield detail.  I understand our cirriculum is ""self directed learning"". However,  when we have class from 8-5, commute home, eat some dinner, we only have about 4 precious hours and personally, that time is spent studying subject that we just went over in lecture that day. I cant ""master the material"" with incomplete resources, and for me, the most important and highly effective resource is the professor and being an ""audio"" learner thats how I learn most efficiently! So apologies for omiting material that hasnt been covered. Also, that students question was misunderstood."
"She is whats right with teaching! Her lecture was perfect! An art form! I loved every second of it and learned so much. Her tone and speaking were amazing, as well as the organization and presentation of it all. Also, she actually incorporated the dreaded ""active learning"" in a HELPFUL manner! Her topic of pericarditis was by far my strongest point and its mostly because of her presentation.","Please come back!",

,"A clear outline that follows logical sequence really helps me learn.",
"Very thorough lecture","I would like to see more evidence regarding the detriment to patients that do not use statins.",
,"Try to keep the research figures to a minimum, a lot of it just looks messy and confusing. For a lot of my classmates, including myself, I lose interest in the subject if were shown the actual results of research. Instead, just summing up the main points would make the lecture much more condensed and a lot easier to study.",
"As always, thank you so much for the drug tables! Theyre so helpful.",,

,,
,"When youre preparing your presentation, please make sure that you include the time that will be used from students asking questions. Also, when one of my classmates asked a question and you snapped at him, it came off as really rude...we are trying to understand a new concept and not having the support of the instructor terrible. You said that we need to read a book to learn the answer and that this is self directed learning, but for almost all of us, the things were learning are completely new concepts and questions that we have are valid. Next time you teach a class, please embrace the questions that we ask because were just trying to become more knowledgeable about the things were learning.",

,"I was quite taken aback by some of the comments made by this professor during his lecture. When asked what I consider fair lecture questions, he responded by telling students to read a book, and went on a 5 minute tangent about how we were not prepared for this lecture. These comments were not well received by the class, and we ended up running out of time. The lecture itself was fine, however I would prefer to not be talked down to by those who are supposed to be teaching me.",

"Dr. Olyaei is a fabulous instructor. His lectures are concise and well laid out. He emphasizes the salient points, and his exam questions always seem fair. I also really appreciate the fact that his lectures are patient-centric. What I mean by that is that he emphasizes cost, side effects, and gives us a good idea of, depending on the type of patient we are seeing, what drugs we would actually prescribe. He is also very receptive to our questions and creates a very comfortable, collaborative learning environment.",,
,,
"Dr. Giraud did an excellent job of laying down the foundation for each of his lectures before jumping into the details. I also appreciated that he emphasized repetition and would return to important points throughout his lecture.","I think Dr. Giraud might try to be a little more receptive to questions. I understand that this curriculum change has been frustrating for many faculty, but when the class doesnt understand a question, I dont think it is entirely appropriate to nearly yell at us for our confusion. It is quite true that we all need to be willing to step up our game and do some investigating and reading outside of lecture, but for some students, they are struggling to even just get through the lecture material, so to tell them that they need to be teaching themselves feels a bit discouraging (even though I agree that self-directed learning is a very important component of medical school).",

"He tells us what we need to know for real life - not just for the test (drug expesnses, pateint concerns, etc.). I love his lectures, especially the one he did this week. I was in the afternoon group, and I know that he tried to pare things down for us - I really appreciated it!! I felt like I really learned a lot of the material as we went. When I looked back at my notes, they made sense. I think that by giving us the most critical information (rather than innundating us with details that we will learn if we become cardiologists) we actually have a chance at remembering this information long term! If you are reading this Dr. Olyaei, thank you for being so clear. I look forward to many more lectures from you in the future!","Maybe the slides could use some improvement, but he is an EXCELLENT instructor. I dont really have any complaints.",
"Excellent instructor. I thoroughly enjoyed his lectures. I also appreciated his respectful attitude toward students and their questions.",,
,,
,"I was very disappointed in the disrespect that he demonstrated toward a student in class. It was not becoming. I too, wish that we had a strong grasp on all of the information. However, I think that if he were to sit in class for as many hours as we do and had as much busy work such as these evaluations and required college events like ""hiking,"" he too would find that it was challenging to find time to learn it all. It would be nice if we all went to pharmacy and medical school prior to attending his class, but alas, that is not possible. We are here to learn.",
,,
,,
,,"I am growing weary with all of the faculty comments about how poorly structured the curriculum is. We are all very well aware, and it is only a further source of discouragement. I am growing extremely (EXTREMELY) concerned about boards. I have no idea whether or not I am actually understanding anything - it seems like I just know a whole smattering of trivia facts and dont have a general framework for any of it."

"Dr. Davies uses very creative analogies that are not always helpful but are always entertaining and helped keep me engaged. I also appreciate his humor.",,

It would have seemed less bias if we were exposed to the details of the studies that refuted some of his claims about Statins... in that way we could have understood why the research was lacking.",

"I thought that the Monday Atherosclerosis lecture was wonderful--very clear and organized.",,
,,
,"I understand that Dr. Giraud would like students to be self-starters and motivated to look up information for themselves, but I did feel that he shut down some legitimate student questions pertaining to physiology. Perhaps it would help him to communicate with board directors prior to his lectures to make sure he understands what information we have yet to receive.",
"Dr. Grauer was so clear and thorough. Her handout/study guide was amazing!!! every professor should follow her lead.",,
,,
,,
,"I felt that the instructor has some amount of bias. He suggested using statins for primary prevention, and there is not scientific consensus on this issue. Also - the JUPITER study was used to back up the instructors claims. The JUPITER study was funded by drug companies and the findings in the JUPITER study are controversial. The results of this study were presented as fact.",
"very clear, lacks any significant conflict of interest",,
,"I enjoyed your presentation very much, however did take issue with some of the epidemiology. You mentioned that the effect of smoking on CVD is likely overstated because it is so highly associated with low socio economic status. There are no studies that would be published in reputable journals that would not control for SES. You could make the argument that this confounder is not adequately controlled for, however I have not seen anything published about that in epidemiological journals. Suffice it to say: I though your point inadequately confused my fellow students. I find that my classmates are so quick to dismiss research because of what a professor says. They are often dismissing it because someone they respect plants false suspicions about an exposure/outcome relationship. This is something that Ive found quite frustrating in med school.",
,,
"He has a lot of experience","I found it harsh that you told the students to ask questions but then became frustrated when they were asking them. Just set the correct expectations. If you want to get through a bunch of slides and you think that your presentation will do a better job of answering the questions, then just say that at the beginning of lecture. To hand out mics, and joke about there not being block directors not being there so that you can be more interactive, but then become frustrated about the questions is just confusing and unfair to students.",
"Such a clear speaker with excellent slides to explain the physiology!! You are one of my favorite professors so far - you are so logical with your explanations and I can tell that you really put some thought into your slides. The presentation had a great flow to it - start with a pathology, explain the pathophys with diagrams, short interactive sessions. I will be going to all of your lectures.",,

I do not mind his conflicts, I just wish he werent so insist that he is above them and that they have no affect on him.","I wish we had a better foundation upon which to learn ECGs, or at least a heads up that we were going to have to teach ourselves."

Very hard to follow lectures when there is absolutely no ""structure"" or as Dr. Gosselin likes to say, an iceberg to put any of the material. From the multitude of review books I have,  I am constantly jumping section to section and there doesnt seem to be any organization.

The Khan academy video you linked was right on the goal and helped with understanding this material. Your lecture was very good. Very clear titles and delineation of concepts. One confusing topic for students was the terms compliance (stretchiness) and capacitance (tank size) which you did a good job about re-explaining to the group based on questions at the break. Finally, I was very impressed by the end of your lecture where you took a case and explained three main concepts (BP basics, laminar vs turbulent flow, and regulation of blood flow).",,

I think you should always stick with the assumption that we know nothing even when you were there teaching it.  I personally dont think its an insult to our/my intelligence.  I think its being thorough.  I guess I was most confused about the real life meaning of the axes of the graphs, so it was really hard to internalize the concepts.  I appreciated that you took the time to tell us where the lines derived from, but I would have appreciated more time having a deeper understanding what the axes were conceptually.  And to be honest, Im not quite sure what your study guide meant when you said it rotated the curve clockwise/counterclock-wise.  Its the intersection of two lines, and while Im sure cardiac output can rotate, can venous return rotate in the same way???<br><br>TL;DR: Always assume we know nothing, have terms from lecture and study guide match, and add in more animation.",

"Your lecture slides were clear and your instruction was quite good. As I prepared to speak with other classmates about this lecture, I told them that the bradycardia section was good but that the tachycardia section shot up in confusion very quickly. I was understanding well but then quickly became confused when talking about reentry pathways. One helpful tool would be to ""assign"" a Khan academy video on the subject in the future as well as to use different colors to show the different paths. Overall, you did quite good.",,

"Dr. Sadehis lecture was awesome! The intro was a bit long, but useful and engaging. I really liked the broad introduction of concepts and the utilization of these concepts in understanding different types of shock and their typical findings.","Not having slides before the lecture made it challenging to stay focused in class as I was trying to write down key information as the lecture was progressing, and I had to ask classmates a few times for statements I had missed because I was focused on writing (its me, not you; I write slowly, sorry!). I think that there would be negligible (none, really) negative consequences of having the slides earlier. Empty tables or blank space-holder slides are a good way to (a) provide slides to students while (b) at the same time keeping the lecture engaging with student synthesis of information. If there are key summary tables, placing these at the end of the lecture would be helpful.",

Its challenging to stay engaged by the end of a day for of lectures, but humor always helps.","As much as it was great to sit back and just listen to the lecture (and it was), I know a lot of people like to have the slides beforehand in order to take notes, etc. Id say a good work-around (because you want to keep the answers hidden) it to put the ""answer"" slides at the end of the powerpoint. If it was me, I wouldnt look ahead (that wouldnt help me learn), but then there would only be 1 version and I could look back to the questions and answers later.",

She contradicted the faculty guide many times by saying ""I don't think that makes sense"" or something to this effect, without elucidating what the faculty guide said, what was wrong about it, and what was the right way to understand the cases. I think that, in the future, Dr. Nonas' small group sessions would be better received if she had taken the time to review the faculty guide and discuss any potential errors/improvements with the writer of the faculty guide beforehand -- that way, she doesn't confuse students in middle of a small group that she is supposed to be leading and students better trust the information that we're getting.","While I appreciate the sensitivity to not having 90+ lecturers for each block, I think improving continuity by reducing # of lecturers necessitates careful selection of who is giving the key lectures. I think that Dr. Nonas' material and style were, in general, poorly received by many students. I found the slide formatting and equation errors extremely distracting and the errors reduced my trust in her competency -- moreover, when answering questions, it seems that she sometimes provides incorrect information."

{question_not_shown},{question_not_shown},"I think the order of the lectures really needs to be reassessed. Traditionally medical school has been taught anatomy, physiology, pathology. I felt that we got this mostly in reverse this block (granted, this block is not unique in that). I understand that part of this is getting times when lecturers are available, but not knowing normal function makes it impossible to understand pathologic lab values. The order of materials presented is especially vital given that we do not have the ""second review"" of the organ systems that every year has had in the past. I think the best thing is to ensure that every item in first aid is being covered, ideally in the order (embryology, anatomy, physiology, pathology). We are all very concerned about our board scores, and having the material presented in a logical flow will help with that anxiety. Starting with broad picture concepts would also really help with this and help engrain the important information - for example, start with normal physiology and the definition of obstructive vs restrictive lung disease.<br><br>TBL needs to continue to be reassessed. The sample problems have not been helpful in formulating overall pictures and understanding of the week's materials. <br><br>Dr. Gold was fabulous, I would love to have more lectures by him.

"Dr. Brooks is a fabulous instructor. She makes the material interesting, engaging, and easy(isn) to understand. I appreciate that she teaches the content in layers of complexity, so that we slowly build up our understanding. I loved the pre-recorded lectures. I like to get all of my prep done over the weekends, so it was nice to build on the readings before even going into class. I would ask, however, that all videos be made available by Saturday night.","There were some discrepancies between the information presented in Dr. Brooks' lecture (mainly, effects of certain neural and hormonal drugs on afferent/efferent arteriole dilation/constriction) and some of the other lectures.

This lecture should have been given to us during the renal segment since we basically taught ourselves how to analyze arterial blood gas. The same thing happened to the pulmonary function test.

I think the best place for this would be on the iRAT Monday section on Sakai or on the test page.

This is all covered in the step 1 boards and the first aid text.  Differentiating surgical vs. not-surgical cancers and which are amenable to chemotherapy and/or radiation is on the boards as well and we didn't cover much of that, if any.  This was commented on by other faculty, that the majority of lung-cancer related material for the step 1 was not covered in the single lung cancer lecture of the lung block.  Very concerning, and med18 will have to add this to the list of cover-on-our-own, but hopefully will be fixed for next year.","Too much time spent re-hashing the alveolar gas equation and the overall monday morning was not well spent.

A lot of the formatting got really messed up on our copy. Also, it seemed like much of the material in this session was redundant from previous lectures. It seemed like we could have built on previous stuff a bit more. I imagine this will happen a bit more for next year.

I fully understood stuff at the time of the lecture, but I can't write everything down.

The only recommendation I would add is to assign Pathoma's lung cancer talk as pre-work (with some blurb about what to focus on or what to put on the back burner).

{question_not_shown},{question_not_shown},"Given that Dr. Bumsted has specifically stated that having all powerpoints posted the Friday before the week should be a metric for success of this program, these really need to be posted on time. Some of us, myself included, have commitments outside of class including work, which subtracts from our study time during the week and requires that most studying be conducted during the weekend. Additionally, without powerpoints I have no organized manner in which to take notes, and it is highly inefficient to wait until after the lecture to go back and update the posted slides. Anything that prevents learning is simply unacceptable, and this includes ""withholding"" powerpoints to encourage active participation. As a class, we have made very clear to previous block directors that not having powerpoints has the opposite effect - it's distracting, it prevents active focus, and it encourages us to skip the lecture rather than waste our time.   I really loved how important ideas and complex concepts were reinforced throughout the week. It was clear that some of the format and instruction had changed from previous years, and this helped to smooth these bumps out a bit.   Also, thank you for the clear and concise study guides this week!"
{question_not_shown},{question_not_shown},"I honestly do not find the irat/grat setup helpful. I wish we could transition to only doing problem representations and make the first hour of the week more of a workshop, as I think this will be most helpful long-term. I also want there to be a way for people who have not had scribe experience to get more practice on an individual level. I feel like the same few people in our class (the ones with the most past experience) are doing the majority of the problem representations/summary statements and the people with less experience, like me, struggle to keep up.  With so many doctors in the room during the first hour, I think that having to all individually present our own problem representation to a doctor and get feedback would be invaluable. I would love it if each team was assigned one doctor and we individually had 5-10 minutes with the doctor to present the patient (from the case of the week) and get feedback individually. As we get closer to the clinical rotations, I think that more and more emphasis needs to be placed on problem representations. We can use the rest of our class time to do multiple choice questions."

"Incredibly positive and knowledgeable. Her excitement about teaching this material is infectious.","Lecture seemed very broad, and there was so much material offered in such little time, that a lot of the key points were lost by the rushed pace.","Focusing more on ""what we need to know"" first, and allowing questions to ensure everyone understands the material before moving on will make this lecture more effective. Perhaps offering more time, and slowing the pace will make the 'take home' messages more clear, and the overall presentation less daunting."
"Again very positive (we had a lot of great energy this week.) I really appreciate that he continues to work with how this material is presented and taught. Every time a new histology class is presented, a he has tweaked the presentation, keeping what works and improving upon what wasn't as effective from the previous session. The pre-lecture is great. The annotated slides are wonderful resources. This time there was even an added video within the lecture that cleared up a renal process perfectly.","Keep doing what you are doing... and allow these classes to continue to evolve. It just keeps getting better and more valuable.",{question_not_shown}
"Good humor and clear instruction","Sometimes, there is material that, although very valuable, may ultimately confuse those of us that are just learning the subject for the first time.

It was also helpful to put the information into context, creating a place in my mind where I can envision myself treating this patient using the lessons learned from class. As you remarked, you had 2 hours to present the information that you did so my recommendation would be to have more time for your topic. I thought it was very important and like you, would have liked more time so it wouldn't have been as rushed. However, I understand the time constraint. Thank you for your time and effort with our class!",{question_not_shown},{question_not_shown}
"Thank you for reviewing the key highlights from the take-home video for us as we started class. I thought you did a good job emphasizing main points and going through the cases with us. The only thing that was somewhat off-putting was that your answer on a question (for example, to use loop instead of thiazide) was inconsistent with the text. I know you talked to us about that these slides were not necessarily yours but I think that was confusing. If you could provide a more clearer picture of your clinical decision making for different classes of diuretics, I think that would help students.",{question_not_shown},{question_not_shown}
"Excellent organization! Sometimes the organization of a lecture can get convoluted in all the details so I really appreciated you bringing us back to home-base with the overview slides.

Excellent job!",{question_not_shown},{question_not_shown}
"Lecture slides and instruction were very clear and logical. In fact, when I was just about to ask a question, you would answer it on the next slide, showing me that you have an understanding of how our minds work. The only two recommendations I have for you are minor. The blue slides with yellow font can be hard on the eyes and difficult to write notes on (black ink doesn't show up well). Also, if you could use a mouse or something similar instead of a laser pointer so that it can be seen on multiple screens and can be seen when re-watched at home.

"Enthusiastic and enjoyable to listen to","It could just be me, but I always feel like Dr. Moulton's lectures are hard to follow. Perhaps a short outline at the beginning of the lecture would clear up the narrative.","The pulmonary block seemed a bit disorganized, especially when compared to renal. I appreciate the attempts to spiral important material (e.g. how to interpret an ABG), but it almost seems like ABG should be hammered out in the first week. Dr. Gold's lecture at the end of week 3, was great for tying everything together. Additionally, lecturers seemed less aware of what students had already learned compared to other blocks. I understand that it is difficult to get all the lecturers on the same page, but it seemed to be a common theme."

{question_not_shown},{question_not_shown},"The nutrition based lectures continually are low yield. As clinicians, the information that medical students take away from these lectures are what we can contribute to patient are. I do think the depth of work a nutritionist provides is key to achieving overall health, but when the breadth of information students are required to learn is as expansive as it is in medical school these lectures need to focus on key concepts in a straightforward model that students should take away. Though perhaps harsh, if theses lectures maintain their current model I think attendance will continue to dwindle or students will stop paying attention to study higher yield concepts."

"I was quite frustrated that mixed acid-base disorder questions were on the pulmonary final without any clear review or recommendation to review this material.

"I am less frustrated by the lecture material than the test questions. I feel that a theme during the pulm section of this block is to expect tricky questions that test random facts that you either memorized or, if you didn't, will get the question wrong. I know that the vast majority of medical education depends on rote memory instead of conceptual understanding but when certain facts are important it would be nice for those facts to be emphasized. Because there are many facts and statistics in each lecture so it becomes very hard to know how to prioritize them. I feel that some of the questions that were on the pulm final were overly dependent on rote memory, and many of the concepts that seemed to be very important from the three weeks were absent from the tested material.",{question_not_shown},{question_not_shown}

"Very informative, patient-centered presentation on dietary needs in CKD.",{question_not_shown},"Dr. Stadler and Dr. McCarthy gave a very informative presentation on dietary needs in CKD patients and while there was absolutely nothing wrong with their presentation, I do strongly question the relevance of providing medical students with this quantity of information about nutrition, which has it's own profession, separate from being a physician. This has been an ongoing theme in the Foundations of Medicine curriculum, we receive, arguably, way too much information about nutrition. I do not think it should be removed completely, but should focus on the big picture -- less protein to prevent X, Y, and Z. Belaboring the amount down to 0.2 gram/kg/day seems excessive and unrealistic for our future practice in any capacity."

It is frustrating to have a lecture start with ""I usually have more time for this (hours, usually- not an insignificant amount!)..."" this makes us feel cheated, and now that it was been over 6 months I am really feeling the crunch of months of a perceived lost time and therefore lost value to our education.

I think some of the concepts that classmate asked was essential to learning the material in the lecture. I understand the lecturer's frustration that we aren't learning some of this basic stuff earlier on, but with this new curriculum, it is the way it is, and unfortunately, we don't have the time or resources to read 7+ chapters from our favorite textbook after being in class/preceptorship/small group pretty much daily 8am-5pm.","I think it would be helpful to provide more high-yield concise resources as prework, such as a video lecture by a faculty member.

Also, I felt bad for her since there was just no way she was going to get through the material - not set up for success at all. Dr. Brooks leisurely went through her material and spilled into Dr. Iragorri's time, but even with that extra time we still would have been going warp speed.

So, thank you!",{question_not_shown},{question_not_shown}
"This was one of your best at-home lectures. You emphasized previous information and were up to date on what we had already learned. Honestly, I think you have an excellent understanding of our thought process because when I had a question about something you had just introduced, you answered it in your next sentence. Your use of color-coding was also phenomenal for helping me learn.   One caveat though. I noticed on the recorded Monday lecture that there were very few students in attendance. I thank you for going out of your way to make these pre-recorded lectures for our review, going over them with clicker Q, and for recruiting faculty to help us with histology. Not to make any excuse, but students were just coming back from break and personally, I didn't feel prepared enough going into the lecture before your's so I decided to go home and study. I want to make sure you don't take the low attendance personally. Thank you for all your effort and time.",{question_not_shown},{question_not_shown}
"This was one of my favorite lectures of the week. I felt like you tied together many very important concepts in reasonable way. There were two really great things you did - you provided us with a reasonable amount of material to cover in the time period, and you brought in current misconceptions and your clinical picture. Specifically, I appreciated how you tied in the idea of a low-salt vs a Western diet and how, contrary to popular belief, this can cause high BP in the general sense. You taught us that this is true for only 25% ish of the population and that the rest are considered salt-insensitive but that there are other health benefits to eating a low-salt diet, which may include future kidney health. The only recommendation I would make looking at the room during lecture would be a little more emphasis on the terminology of salt-sensitive vs salt-insensitive. Personally, the word sensitive has a positive connotation and such, I was expecting that a salt-sensitive person would be the ideal. The terminology is not immediately intuitive and I think that tripped some people up. Perhaps a question to check our understanding about half way  through the lecture would have been helpful. Additionally, I would do a similar check for understanding question right before combining the cardiac concepts with the newly introduced renal function curve. Otherwise, I think you did a great job! I am a linear thinking and found it very helpful the way you were connecting the concepts with flow diagrams (slide ""acute perturbation of the system: non-steady state"")",{question_not_shown},{question_not_shown}
"Fabulous lecturer, interactive, leads us through the thought process for her concepts.  Very engaging. Great study guide. I found her simple explanations of acid-base balances very helpful for understanding them!",{question_not_shown},{question_not_shown}
"Conscientious: she wanted to explain a lot of the background concepts to us in detail. Ambitious to cover a lot of material in such a short amount of time. She really knows her material very well.",{question_not_shown},"I think Dr Iragorri probably went into more detail than she really needed to with some of these concepts, judging by First Aid."
"Your lectures are always very good at explaining complex processes in an easy to understand way. Your study guides are AMAZING. Please continue to provide these.","Your Friday ""Disorders of Na and Water Balance"" session was very helpful, however I felt like there should have been an additional document with the rational for each answer. I had a difficult time taking notes fast enough and when I went back to study for the exam, I found myself lacking some information and wanting a study guide that summarized/explained the answers.","I'm not sure who designed them, but the Thursday labs were amazing! They did a great job of reinforcing what we learned in lecture and expanding our knowledge base. Please keep giving us labs like these!!"
"I really like how you structure the material. You are a very engaging lecturer!","Many instructors have chosen to provide us with study guides of their material and we have found this VERY helpful, particularly when trying to grasp this more complex material. Please consider creating a study guide for your lecture material.  Thank you!","I realize they are shortening the length of many lectures because of the condensed curriculum, but I would highly recommend they keep this particular lecture at the full 2 hours! Not only is this material complex and difficult to understand, it is very important! I honestly can't imagine how they expected this material to be covered in less than 2 hours."

"I really like Dr. Iragorri but she got really frazzled and stressed during her lecture on Wednesday which made us even more overwhelmed by the material which was dense information. I think it is really important for professors to recognize how it affects us when they say things like ""this lecture used to be two hours"" or ""we have so much information to cover I don't know how we will get through it all."" For us students these types of remarks and facts don't give us a lot of faith in the system.",{question_not_shown},{question_not_shown}

"I really likes the study guides and that you printed them out and brought them to class for us.","Please please please post all of your lecture notes and slides and study guides ahead of time.  I realize you like to use the white board and do things in person but many students (myself included) really need to be able to read through this material ahead of time.  It is also really helpful to have the slides on our computers to take notes in class.",{question_not_shown}
"Great physiology resources.  Your study guides are quite good.  Very strong enthusiasm and great slide/presentation-drawing/teaching balance.  I wish for more teaching and more instructors willing to do this!","Take over more lectures. Maybe the davenport diagram as a flipped/pre-recorded lecture?  Would give more time for ""sinking in"" of the concepts and allow students to rewind/rewatch more than once without taking too much of your in-class time.",{question_not_shown}
"Content EXPERT.  great use of clinical experience as teaching points.","You mentioned the usual time for the lecture as 2 hours, I think that breaking it into 2 separate one-hour lectures would be sufficient.","Agree, less time on the davenport diagram.  While helpful and effective, would be really well suited to a flipped lecture or as a pre-recorded session.  Also the small groups are valuable but perhaps if the session leaders could be encouraged to keep the discussions on-track, that would help.  As an example, we had one particular student who de-railed the conversation in a poor direction, and that made the entire session run over by almost 20 minutes."
{question_not_shown},"Dr. Iragorri, I appreciate your effort in getting through all the causes of metabolic acidosis.  However, I think it might have been a little more beneficial to slow down and understand the major points.

{question_not_shown},"It is painful to go through the semantics of these questions. Too much time is spent going over them. I do not know who has said that we aren't spending enough time, but that is not the general opinion of the class. I would rather use this time to be taught/learn things correctly. The guess and check method of TBL does not work for me and creates confusion, because people think they understand things when they do not and perpetuate incorrect ideas. Later I have a hard time sorting out the incorrect guesses from the correct truths.","I am frustruated with the structure of the course. I feel like we blow through complex topics very quickly and beat simpler things into the ground. It would be better if we paced ourselves. I prefer to learn the details of a process one time, correctly, and in full completeness, rather than learning the same things over and over with increasing levels of depth."

I believe that I better preparation for the week would be to have more general overarching questions in the IRAT on Monday.

{question_not_shown},"Make a concise study guide with all of the important testable material very CLEAR.  Don't make the study guide a narrative, make it very bullet-point and direct.  Also, include the presenter's lecture notes attached to the pdf powerpoint on Sakai.  Make sure that all of the materials are posted way ahead of time.","Please give us our exam grades immediately after!  There is no reason to withhold grades until the following week - it would be helpful for our learning if we could know how we did and review the material over the weekend. For the students that have to take the exam later it doesn't matter if the rest of us know our grades.  It is simply unacceptable to keep our grades unknown to us - if there are questions that are going to be thrown out then our grades will only get better not worse so giving them right afterwards makes the most sense."
"First session on Monday (Introduction to Renal Syndromes) was well done. Clear slides, really appreciated having arrows pointing from text to images on the slides.","Unfortunately, the Renal Tumors session did not go well at all. However, I think it can be improved drastically relatively easily. We have had a number of phenomenal histology sessions from Dr. Schnapp which should serve as examples for other histology sessions. However, this did not follow that format. Some attributes which were not present in this session which have been immensely helpful for Schnapp's sessions are outlined here: 1) Clear identification of pre-work as being critical for participation in the session 2) High yield pre-work - the provided document was 90% text which was quite difficult to digest when the material we are going over is largely visual.  3) Introduction of material building up slowly prior to the session - the provided document dove right in and was very dense with very little build up / progression. 4) Annotations directly in slidebox - this was a HUGE improvement in Schnapp's sessions. Before they included annotations it was very difficult to figure out what was what and we had to call an instructor over every single time to double check. Annotating things in slidebox for us to view via the narrative would free the instructor up to answer true questions about the material, rather than ""I think this is a tubule but I'm not sure because it doesn't look like the google images"" questions.  5) Identification of what the session actually is. Sakai said it was a lab, but for typical labs we don't need computers (iPads will do). However, we were unprepared for the session in this regard as well.","Many students have given positive feedback regarding Dr. Schnapp's sessions. I think the entire class would be happy if every histology session henceforth modeled his format."

"Clarity of the slides was outstanding, as was the organization. Really appreciated the labels with arrows pointing to histological features like on her Tubulointerstitial Fibrosis slide. She went quite fast but since the slides had these arrows and annotations already I was able to sit back and listen much more than during lectures which have less clear slides or slides which require more annotation on my part. Also really appreciated having slides in the exact same order in both our copy and her copy, and having slide numbers on both copies. I zoned out for a slide and was able to quickly reorient myself when I refocused. She presented things at a great level for our knowledge and delivered it in a very no nonsense kind of manner. Good use of the concept map early in the slide set. As far as traditional lectures are concerned, hers was pretty exemplary of what we like. While there was no form of active learning present in the session and I am certainly a proponent of in-depth and engaging clicker questions, I think that this is a perfect example of a session which was engaging and lent itself well to the traditional style. Clicker questions would have significantly disrupted her flow.","It would have been nice to have a verbal warning that we were shifting gears between topics. For instance, she went from talking about pathology on the Tubular Proteinuria slide (23) instantly into the Screening for Proteinuria slide (24) with zero pause. It would have been helpful for her to say ""ok, now we're going to switch gears from talking about pathology to talking about screening and labs"" before launching into it so that we could reorient ourselves mentally.",{question_not_shown}

{question_not_shown},{question_not_shown},"The past two weeks have been very bizarre in terms of organization. I feel like we kept briefly touching on random bits and pieces of topics and then revisited them again and again throughout the week. It was very difficult for me to organize my thoughts and notes on these topics. It would be better to just keep all of the nephrotic/nephritic stuff together. Dr. Dirxx and Troxell did a great job. The mention of these syndromes in earlier lectures was not necessary and did not seem to flow well.   Also, it would be helpful if lectureres could keep their slide sets to a 50 slide minimum and try to condense the information on their slides down. It has been really challenging to get through all of the slides in addition to the study guides and other resources. Setting a slide limit would also facilitate a more enjoyable viewing experience - sometimes professors change slides so quickly that it is hard to keep up with taking notes (some of the slides only have one line on them and just get skipped over).

"Very informative, patient-centered presentation on dietary needs in CKD.",{question_not_shown},"Dr. Stadler and Dr. McCarthy gave a very informative presentation on dietary needs in CKD patients and while there was absolutely nothing wrong with their presentation, I do strongly question the relevance of providing medical students with this quantity of information about nutrition, which has it's own profession, separate from being a physician. This has been an ongoing theme in the Foundations of Medicine curriculum, we receive, arguably, way too much information about nutrition. I do not think it should be removed completely, but should focus on the big picture -- less protein to prevent X, Y, and Z. Belaboring the amount down to 0.2 gram/kg/day seems excessive and unrealistic for our future practice in any capacity."

For example there was a question about composite outcomes, neither I nor anyone else who was in the small group with Dr. Gorman got that question right, probably because there was somehow some lack of communication or clarification on the topic. In the future it would be helpful if we could ensure that our understandings as students match what the expectations are for the exams, specially when it comes to epidimiology.

{question_not_shown},{question_not_shown},"I think the pulmonary final included many questions that were quite trivial in comparison to important concepts that were covered this block. I spent many hours studying and then found on the test that if I had not memorized important words like ""fluffy"" or very specific details about how to treat certain diseases then I got the question wrong, because there could be no conceptual reasoning involved in answering the question. In fact I often felt during this block that we were not adequately prepared by lecture material to answer the test questions. Or test writers were trying to trick us a bit on the questions. I think that tuesday and thursday afternoon should be protected time for small group and hands on learning to practice lecture material from monday and wednesday.  It is especially hard to get new material on Thursday's when we have a test the next morning, which happened the first week of this block and then many many concepts from that 4pm lecture showed up on the test. And in detail that was not covered in class. I think this block could have been organized better in terms of lecture and small group and I think that block directors should have reviewed test questions to check if the exams truly assessed the main points they hoped we had gained from the pulmonary section of the block."

This did not happen (with the exception of Dr. Dirkx's lecture, which was great). Several lectures (lipid metabolism, etc) seemed to have no place in this block and were not the best use of time."

We need clear written information in case things are missed in communication.  Please make a study guide and also include reading from our required textbooks (no research paper type stuff).

"Fabulous lecture!!! Tracy's slides were clear and flowed very well (and had very useful images and information). I really appreciated the comparison of the various diets, as we have not had a chance to understand them as of yet.

The case at the end was very useful and took into account the dilemma of fast food.","While collaborating with a dietician is incredibly useful and should obviously be done if possible, I think that students may have come away with the idea that they do not need to know the details about nutrition. I think it would be useful to emphasize that many physicians do not have access to dieticians or cannot utilize them due to insurance reasons.

{question_not_shown},"Far FAR too may graphs and non essential material and information. We don't need to make these decisions outright, and need a better understanding of how to evaluate a patient for their applicability to statin therapy vs. other regimens.  What about the role of reducing these medications as our patients progress and meet goals? I have 2 patients that will agree to starting therapy if there is a plan to reduce therapy if they meet certain goals, but we don't have any data from you on how to reduce doses, etc.","We already had a statins lecture. Two, actually. The one from Dr. Duell was very poorly delivered and pushed statins as the best thing since sliced bread but had very little credit or importance on the side effect of rhabdo, and the one from Fazio was not much better. Dr. Olyaei, on the other hand, presented the material very objectively and put the concept of statins in context as to primary vs. secondary prevention and let us see the data objectively."
{question_not_shown},{question_not_shown},"Not using objectives.CSL was a bit combative in my group and fairly low-yield as the lack of context for the assignment resulted in a huge variety (unnecessarily so) in the class responses and made for less productive discussion and more defensive positions."

{question_not_shown},{question_not_shown},"This was a difficult lecture to give, combing both the biochemical pathways of lipid metabolism while trying to discuss the pathological illnesses that arise. Though students may have rated Dr. Purnell poorly I feel it was a failure of curriculum structure that may have led to this being a not well received lecture. Pre-work items need to be posted. I understand that TSO is pulled in many different directions, but the frequency with which materials are missing has become distraction. I think system changes need to be made so TSO is given ample time to post materials and technological gliches are limited so the class does not come to lecture unprepared. The second curriculum error in this lecture is that it constrained the teaching by grouping physiology and pathology into one. Though the curriculum is pushing change the Flexner method of physiology before pathology holds true for how to most effectively teach students. As such, I would argue this lecture belongs in the GI block or a greater emphasis be placed on the pertinent physiology for this topic. If not, I think the administration is constraining both the faculty's effectiveness to teach and the students ability to learn such that attendance in class will continue to decline."

Extra review sessions with he and Dr. Bonura would be appreciated!",{question_not_shown},"Regarding NBME exam: There are always specific questions on this exam that were never covered in class. I think it would be reasonable to have a student from our class sit in on the post-test review/statistical analysis that is done by administration to point out these questions to faculty since there is no instructor (including block directors) that have sat in on every lecture. This is especially important because there is no way for us to give ""feedback"" on questions as we can on ExamSoft tests. I know that statistical analysis is done, but that may fail considering that we all use a variety of extracurricular study/review resources where some of us (or even a majority) may learn something that is on the exam but was not taught by instructors. This was the case for me on a couple of questions today. Many of us use Pathoma and I got at least two questions right because of this that were not otherwise taught. This puts those few people who do not use Pathoma at a disadvantage because most of us likely got the questions right and statistically this makes them look they the subjects were ""taught."""

I have spent so much time this block cramming for ridiculous minutia that I have a poor understanding of critical concepts in physiology, histology and microbiology. Ironically, I feel like I understand some of the pathophysiology better than the actual normal physiology. Drugs and microbes are a lost cause. I am deeply unhappy, because I do not think that I will be able to pass the last two components and, even worse, that I will have a good understanding of the actually necessary material for boards.

{question_not_shown},{question_not_shown},"I think the organization of the block needs to be reconsidered. Given the complexity of the heart, that should have been taught last. We absolutely NEED to have more than one day to study for finals. Here are a few general thoughts-PLEASE don't introduce new material the week of the NMBE. PLEASE. PLEEEEEASE. I would so much rather lengthen our duration of lectures and push back the boards and clinical rotations than have this keep happening.-Dr. Levvett's microbiology lecture has a picture of Strep Pneumoniae under Neisseria. Therefore, every one of the study guides that people were sharing includes that picture as Neisseria. This should help explain why so much of the class struggles to differentiate gram positive from gram negative.-As a class, people are still really struggling with drugs. I realize the term ""spiraling"" has become the new ""active learning"" catchphrase, but something has to be done about this.-PLEASE start each organ from the beginning with normal physiology, THEN pathology. Pathology doesn't make sense if we don't know normal.-Never, ever, ever give us more than one anatomy session a week. Ever. I've already been mocked by surgeons and attendings for the class's abysmal anatomy knowledge, and having that schedule isn't helping. -Having more than one hour of required video to watch before a given day seems inappropriate. You're the teachers, so please teach us - don't let Khan academy or pre-recorded lectures do the teaching. -The adjusted histology sessions are helpful, thank you for listening to us!"
{question_not_shown},"We should have been given a specific list of organisms that we were going to be tested on earlier in this block.  It should have been made clear earlier on in the year that the organisms we are taught could come back on future tests, in different blocks.  Not knowing what specific organisms we were going to be tested until the Tuesday before the test was terrible.  This lack of clarity created a great deal of UNNECESSARY stress that could have easily been AVOIDED.  I greatly resent any professor who creates unnecessary stress.",{question_not_shown}
