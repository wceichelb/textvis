"","","Considering this is the CARDIOpulmonary and renal block and we are working through the heart for this first section, learning about nutrition before learning about cardiac muscle, cardiac rhythm, or anything related to cardiac physiology seems highly questionable. For example, we learned about drugs to treat various pathologies without exposure to any of the underlying pathologies that we would treat with said drugs. Very hard to follow lectures when there is absolutely no ""structure"" or as Dr. Gosselin likes to say, an iceberg to put any of the material. From the multitude of review books I have,  I am constantly jumping section to section and there doesn't seem to be any organization. I would prefer to have the background information delivered first in the traditional lecture format, with supplemental information such as nutrition at the end of the block when I can fully appreciate and understand the clinical application nutrition, etc. ","gearenc@ohsu.edu"

"Dr. Habecker makes it clear what we need to know and understands her material very well.","I think this weeks lecture went very poorly for multiple reasons.  The biggest being that we basically started with a worksheet with no lecture.  I think active learning and working on worksheets like this can be useful but we need more direction and preparation.  Even with prework and reading it makes a huge difference for an instructor to spend a bit time of time teaching us before we try and reason it our ourselves.  With little to no lecture before trying to fill out a worksheet we were extremely inefficient.  I spent much of the class on wiki, up to date, books, and other resources just looking information up.  Why come to a lecture if I could just sit at home and look info up and have a similar experience?","Previous lectures have been better but my above comments are in regards to this weeks lecture.","habecker@ohsu.edu"
"Dr. Moulton is very good at working with the students, understanding where we are coming from, and trying to help us.  I think he is good at speaking to the group and keeping the lecture engaging.

This is fine if we don't actually need to know all of that but it felt unclear and it seemed like we touched on parts of some but never truly delved into them.  Lastly, this is not for this specific lecture but overall the lectures felt disconnected and in the overall idea of learning cardiac medicine im unsure how things connect.","Overall I really like Dr. Moulton and look forward to more lectures.  This week in general though felt like a very odd and scattered way to begin cardio.","moulton@ohsu.edu"

Still, I think the strength of this embryology in-class learning bit was that you gave the information we had to use right before you had us do it, so it was more of a reinforcement of what we learned.  Your week 1 was good too, but this one was a lot better because there was so little time between learning the material and then using it in an in-class activity, so there wasn't much time to forget.

"Knew the material well. ","More time explaining the fundamental concepts of the lecture thoroughly please.I understand that questions need to be answered, but the material needs to be explained first at a basic level before there is time to answer answer advance questions, which are not relevant to the fundamentals of the lecture. Thus I felt that we rushed the lecture at points and I had trouble fully grasping the basic concepts. More time explaining the concepts thoroughly please. Otherwise it was a good session.","","mudd@ohsu.edu"
"He knows his stuff.","I was really confused at what the objective of this lecture was and assumed that we need to know everything. Things should have bee presented at the most basic level because this was our first exposure to ECGs. Also it was the first exposure to how myocardial cells depolarize and how autonomicity works. Thus most of the lecture was mostly over our heads. Maybe some youtube videos should be required before lecture to get the fundamentals down, or there needs to be a revision of when this lecture is presented in relation to the other material.","The second week to this block was very disorganized. Material wasn't presented in the correct order and it seemed there was no communication between instructors. The major issue was how the monday and thursday ECG stuff was presented. The thursday afternoon ecg lab was great because the ER doc knew that we knew nothing. Why wasn't his steps of how to read ECG given to us on Monday? Monday's ECG lecture left me more confused than anything. I was very confused on how to organize my study time this week when there was so much material to cover. The fetal lecture contained lots of information and should have been split over two weeks. Please look at how material is being presented and how much. Basic concepts could be presented though required YouTube videos before class. Youtube videos on the frank starling curve are great!!","steckere@ohsu.edu"

"Your demonstration about the different fibers of the smooth muscle and the ""naked tropomyosin"" was very effective for me and I appreciate your creativity. Perhaps others groan about it but I think it can really be effective for visual learners. Your lecture was very good but I will admit, I found it difficult to maintain focus given that we had just finished our exam. I liked how you kept referencing what we had learned with the skeletal muscle but at times, I would think we were talking about smooth muscle instead of skeletal muscle. My recommendation would be to use different font colors or different symbols on the slides to highlight which type of muscle you are speaking about. Otherwise, great job!","","","cameronw@ohsu.edu"
"Your study guide and handout were helpful but I think where the instruction was lacking most was in 1) your speed and 2) your explanations of how you had changed things. I appreciate your effort and time spent on creating this lecture, but the organization was quite difficult to wrap my head around. Perhaps a slide at the beginning quickly referencing the outline of the lecture. As I was reviewing lecture material and using outside resources (namely Youtube), I found it most helpful to think of the receptor categories (briefly) and then explain some of the drugs (pick the top 3 for example). If we understand how those work, then we can much more easily figure out the effect and other similar or antagonistic drugs. Use hypertension or hypotension as great starting points for cases. I think it would also be helpful to speak somewhat faster during lecture. ","","","habecker@ohsu.edu"
"First off, thank you for your willingness to teach our class. I thought you did a great job! One of the biggest things I recall about your lecture was that you asked us at the beginning how many watch videos.

The Khan academy video you linked was right on the goal and helped with understanding this material. Your lecture was very good. Very clear titles and delineation of concepts. One confusing topic for students was the terms compliance (stretchiness) and capacitance (tank size) which you did a good job about re-explaining to the group based on questions at the break. Finally, I was very impressed by the end of your lecture where you took a case and explained three main concepts (BP basics, laminar vs turbulent flow, and regulation of blood flow). ","","","chien@ohsu.edu"
"Thank you for teaching our class. Your enthusiasm was completely apparent and appreciated. You did a great job of explaining the baroreflex. As I scroll back through my notes, I feel like a got a strong understanding of the baroreflex from your lecture, including its relation to pathologies like obesity. I liked how you took the time to do the tilt table experiment but given that there wasn't a pronounced change in either US or the HR, it wasn't very clear what we were observing. I understood the concept after you debriefed it but perhaps a conversation could occur before the experiment to discuss what we expect to happen and then be looking for that in particular. The time that we took to talk with our peers about the different cases or questions you presented was also great. One difficulty I had with your lecture was with the RAAS system portion. It seemed very surface level and I think we are expected to know more detail than what was explained for our Step 1 exam. RAAS by itself could have been a whole lecture so perhaps one solution would be to assign the Khan academy videos on RAAS, telling us which one or two videos you want us to watch. Otherwise, I thought you did an excellent job!","","","houghtob@ohsu.edu"

"Materials were great.  Slides are concise with clear information","Order of material presented could be improved.  we should first go over the basics of what is the sympathetic chain?? then discuss how depending on what you're innervating, the way the nerves get there is different.  then go through the worksheets in order to compare and contrast each one.  then watch the video (since it was extremely dense and synthesized the material).  I came to class hoping to have the video explained since I didn't understand it whatsoever, and instead we were told to work on the worksheets--which I had no idea how to fill out because I didn't understand the video.  In a flipped classroom, we watch a short video that explains a key concept, then we go over it in class to check for understanding.  We didn't do that--we just further exasperated our misunderstanding by working on the worksheets.  This was a challenging concept that I think should be presented differently in the future in order to optimize student understanding of the material.","These slides/video should have been posted sooner.","nelsens@ohsu.edu"

"","Really had a hard time with the active learning activity, even having watched the video just the night before. The video itself was very challenging to follow as a first pass through the material, and then the exercise in class expected us to regurgitate that. Unfortunately, I think it was an extremely poor use of time, but it could be vastly improved in a couple ways. One way would be to have a more basic into video to get our feet on the ground. A second thing would be to have more instruction at the beginning of class to build on the basics from the video. After that, the active learning exercise would have worked as designed. However, as it was presented, the pre work video was better used as final review. ","Really unclear how Dr. Nelsen's lecture fit as the first lecture of our block, and how it fits into everything else. Seems like we dove straight into very detailed stuff without learning the big picture first. ","nelsens@ohsu.edu"
"The group activities and team learning are a waste of time - instead of having us fill out worksheets just provide all of the materials ahead of time completely filled in and then let us just memorize it.

"""active learning"" is not handing us a worksheet and telling us to find the answers. If the testable material is going to be a majority of the drugs from the drug list, I expect to be TAUGHT those drugs. I felt I had to teach myself all of the material presented. Worksheets are best as a reinforcement of lectured materials not as a pre-work.

","Considering this is the CARDIOpulmonary and renal block and we are working through the heart for this first section, learning about nutrition before learning about cardiac muscle, cardiac rhythm, or anything related to cardiac physiology seems highly questionable. For example, we learned about drugs to treat various pathologies without exposure to any of the underlying pathologies that we would treat with said drugs. Very hard to follow lectures when there is absolutely no ""structure"" or as Dr. Gosselin likes to say, an iceberg to put any of the material. From the multitude of review books I have,  I am constantly jumping section to section and there doesn't seem to be any organization. I would prefer to have the background information delivered first in the traditional lecture format, with supplemental information such as nutrition at the end of the block when I can fully appreciate and understand the clinical application nutrition, etc. ","habecker@ohsu.edu"

Does the research suggest one way or another? Have recent articles come out suggesting a change? What's the basis for doing this?

It is not reasonable to ask us to go learn and memorize all of these drugs (which are really important) without first walking us through them.

In addition, the discussion questions presented were a bit too broad and nebulous. During lecture, I do not find it useful to try to guess at answers to questions about material that has not been presented. Typically this results in simply googling the information and guessing at what concept the lecturer is getting at. Conversely, it is much more helpful to do activities where we use the information that has just been given--either through mapping out the feedback loops or solving an example problem related to the material given.","","houghtob@ohsu.edu"

"She did a great job on the embryology lectures. Very clear.","Please come up with a standardized method for listing structures on our anatomy exams - preferrably the accepted method (e.g. ""renal pelvis of the right kidney"") as this is what our attendings will use. It is very frustruating when some structures are listed in one way (organ first, then side citation, then structure) while other are listed in another (side citation, structure, parent organ). I studied exclusively off of the anatomy hive list, but I truly struggled finding the structures in the list on today's exam, even though I knew them in their correctly formated form. The actual structure should be listed first and then cited back to its organ. This would also make the exam more challenging because you have to actually know the structure - you aren't just picking form a list of structures under ""Heart - ."" I am feeling frustruated with the grading system as well. I earned an A on the first Anatomy legitimately, while many others had elevated scores due to acceptance of multiple INCORRECT answers (three muscles of extensor compartment were accepted even though the tag was very clear). Now the format is flipped and I am having a hard time finding things in the list and am getting much worse scores.

Many students use OneNote or other programs to keep notes electronically, and not all programs handle the higher size content of those powerpoints well.

Additionally, without powerpoints I have no organized manner in which to take notes, and it is highly inefficient to wait until after the lecture to go back and update the posted slides. Anything that prevents learning is simply unacceptable, and this includes ""withholding"" powerpoints to encourage active participation. As a class, we have made very clear to previous block directors that not having powerpoints has the opposite effect - it's distracting, it prevents active focus, and it encourages us to skip the lecture rather than waste our time.

I also want there to be a way for people who have not had scribe experience to get more practice on an individual level. I feel like the same few people in our class (the ones with the most past experience) are doing the majority of the problem representations/summary statements and the people with less experience, like me, struggle to keep up.  With so many doctors in the room during the first hour, I think that having to all individually present our own problem representation to a doctor and get feedback would be invaluable. I would love it if each team was assigned one doctor and we individually had 5-10 minutes with the doctor to present the patient (from the case of the week) and get feedback individually. As we get closer to the clinical rotations, I think that more and more emphasis needs to be placed on problem representations.

"Incredibly positive and knowledgeable. Her excitement about teaching this material is infectious.","Lecture seemed very broad, and there was so much material offered in such little time, that a lot of the key points were lost by the rushed pace. ","Focusing more on ""what we need to know"" first, and allowing questions to ensure everyone understands the material before moving on will make this lecture more effective. Perhaps offering more time, and slowing the pace will make the 'take home' messages more clear, and the overall presentation less daunting. ","iragorri@ohsu.edu"
"Again very positive (we had a lot of great energy this week.) I really appreciate that he continues to work with how this material is presented and taught. Every time a new histology class is presented, a he has tweaked the presentation, keeping what works and improving upon what wasn't as effective from the previous session. The pre-lecture is great. The annotated slides are wonderful resources. This time there was even an added video within the lecture that cleared up a renal process perfectly. ","Keep doing what you are doing... and allow these classes to continue to evolve. It just keeps getting better and more valuable.","","schnappb@ohsu.edu"
"Good humor and clear instruction","Sometimes, there is material that, although very valuable, may ultimately confuse those of us that are just learning the subject for the first time. ""Not even the majority practicing doctors know this but..."" may be material that could muddy the waters of understanding more that provide clarity. I am not suggesting that Cohen, not provide this information. I am merely suggesting he provides this information, knowing that it has the potential of confusing some.","","cohend@ohsu.edu"

"My favorite thing about your lecture were your pediatric cases! They were so helpful in tying pieces together and really helped me to make sure that I am seeing the person and not just the numbers. It was also helpful to put the information into context, creating a place in my mind where I can envision myself treating this patient using the lessons learned from class. As you remarked, you had 2 hours to present the information that you did so my recommendation would be to have more time for your topic. I thought it was very important and like you, would have liked more time so it wouldn't have been as rushed. However, I understand the time constraint. Thank you for your time and effort with our class!","","","iragorri@ohsu.edu"
"Thank you for reviewing the key highlights from the take-home video for us as we started class. I thought you did a good job emphasizing main points and going through the cases with us. The only thing that was somewhat off-putting was that your answer on a question (for example, to use loop instead of thiazide) was inconsistent with the text. I know you talked to us about that these slides were not necessarily yours but I think that was confusing. If you could provide a more clearer picture of your clinical decision making for different classes of diuretics, I think that would help students. ","","","cohend@ohsu.edu"
"Excellent organization! Sometimes the organization of a lecture can get convoluted in all the details so I really appreciated you bringing us back to home-base with the overview slides. I also enjoyed your emphasis on diet and nutrition as contributing to or helping to solve the problems discussed. The case examples were also very illustrative and helped in remembering key concepts. Excellent job!","","","rozansky@ohsu.edu"
"Lecture slides and instruction were very clear and logical. In fact, when I was just about to ask a question, you would answer it on the next slide, showing me that you have an understanding of how our minds work. The only two recommendations I have for you are minor. The blue slides with yellow font can be hard on the eyes and difficult to write notes on (black ink doesn't show up well). Also, if you could use a mouse or something similar instead of a laser pointer so that it can be seen on multiple screens and can be seen when re-watched at home. Otherwise, I appreciated your lecture and could look back at your lecture to clarify some topics brought up later in the week. ","","","watnicks@ohsu.edu"

"Dr. Sadehi's lecture was awesome! The intro was a bit long, but useful and engaging. I really liked the broad introduction of concepts and the utilization of these concepts in understanding different types of shock and their typical findings.","Not having slides before the lecture made it challenging to stay focused in class as I was trying to write down key information as the lecture was progressing, and I had to ask classmates a few times for statements I had missed because I was focused on writing (it's me, not you; I write slowly, sorry!). I think that there would be negligible (none, really) negative consequences of having the slides earlier. Empty tables or blank space-holder slides are a good way to (a) provide slides to students while (b) at the same time keeping the lecture engaging with student synthesis of information.

Also, the last chart regarding atropine was never discussed in class.  That chart was extremely important to know for the test and we spent zero time on it in class.

","Unfortunately, i didn't find the worksheets at the beginning to be a good active learning exercise. Simply looking things up is something we can do at home and discourages those of us who show up. I think it would have been better to have that material presented traditionally, and then use those charts to work more with reasoning through the physiology in an active manner like we did later on in her presentation. Additionally, it seemed like there were a lot of inconsistencies in terms of what drugs were involved between the worksheet, drug list, the study guide, and the lecture. Specifically, drugs which appeared on the worksheet were nowhere in the slides or drug list. This made it more difficult to figure out specifically what drugs we were responsible for being familiar with.","","habecker@ohsu.edu"

"","We got lost in the weeds a bit with ECG interpretation. I had hoped Dr. Stecker's lecture would talk more about the electrical conduction of the specific areas of the heart and the movement of the impulse during the cardiac cycle. When the objective summary was posted at the end of his session, it seemed like the 4 four points or so were not talked about very much and most of the lecture involved the last 2 points which concerned ECG business. I think most of the class would have liked more time with the conduction content, since EKGs were covered in more depth in a later session.","","steckere@ohsu.edu"
"He did a decent job with his lecture, but it was too complex and the basics were not presented. In his defense, this was largely on the shoulders of the block directors/schedulers. Having a lecture on electrical conductance and EKG before even hearing about the cardiac cycle seems a bit unreasonable.","","With regards to progression of presented materials, this block has not gotten off to a good start. It seems logical that we should have been presented with the fundamentals of cardiology before diving into pathologies, EKGs, excitation-contraction coupling, etc. We were presented with 6 days of cardiology before even hearing about the basic cardiac cycle. We have still not had lectures dedicated to fundamentals such as the Frank-Starling Curve and cardiac muscle. This is unfair to the lecturers who have come to teach us more advanced topics that we cannot yet wrap our heads around and more importantly, unfair to us. I have struggled these past two weeks to teach myself the fundamentals of cardiology so that I can begin to even understand the expectations of these more advanced topics.

It helps for us to use example questions as a way to assess your expectations of us and for you to understand the effectiveness of your instruction. I think you did a pretty good job at this.

"","","The material:  It is interesting, I enjoy learning about it. The Exam:  -I felt the questions about ECGs were completely unreasonable in that they required a level of knowledge far greater than would could have been acquired during the course of last week.  Moreover, we had one two-hour session on ECGs the day before the test, during which the professor had to alter his teaching plan to cover the fundamentals of reading an EKG because the majority of the class did not feel comfortable reading abnormal ECGs.  Despite this, we were asked the next day during the test to examine an abnormal ECG and identify it cause.  When I encountered those ECG questions on the test Friday, for the first time in medical school I felt completely dumbfounded- I had absolutely no idea where to begin to analyzing the ECG because the fundamental concepts of rate, rhythm, axis were not helpful in identifying the ECG. -I was surprised at how little material about pressure-volume relationship and CO-venous return curves appeared on the exam  My health:  It's bad- every single week of medical school, I get 0-5 hours of sleep the night before the exam despite putting all of my energies into school during the week.  I don't have time to exercise or have a social life.  The weekend comes around and I am completely exhausted, but I have to study ahead for next week or else I know I won't have any time to sleep the night before the test.  I blame this lifestyle mostly on the curriculum design and partly on my ambitiousness.  The curriculum design is problematic for me because it requires me to attend class all day when I am a poor auditory learner.  I learn best through reading and for that reason I love it when professors post study guides.  Readings- how can we read ahead or do pre-readings when we are in class all day and have to go home and study what we learned in class?  There is no time to do additional readings when we have to learn what we are taught in class.  ","mccammoa@ohsu.edu"
"","","This isn't directly related to this week, but I'm having a hard time learning in anatomy, and I'm hoping that the situation can be improved. It is really hard to learn anatomy during labs when there are 15 students crowded around a single cadaver, and the same issue arises during faculty tutorial time. This isn't as much an issue for the structures that are easy to identify independently using a Netters app, but for the smaller structures that are hard to identify from a picture, it's a real problem because I never end up seeing them and learning them in a cadaver.  (Even the students that have taken anatomy before often can't help teach this, because undergrad anatomy classes often don't go that much into depth.) If there's any way we could get more small group time, or more time focusing on the smaller structures (minor arteries, small nerves, etc.), that would be really helpful.   Somewhat related to this - in general, there are some structures that pointed out over and over again in anatomy, and there are some structures that are never or almost never shown. I know that there are too many structures to identify them all during a four hour class period, but it's demoralizing when these structures aren't shown on cadavers and then appear on a test. (For example, I only saw the thoracic cardiac nerves once, and not in our ""official"" anatomy lab - I had to specifically ask an instructor to point them out to me during a faculty lab period in order to see them at all.) I admittedly don't have any good ideas on how to rectify this, since I know there are time and space limitations, but it would be really helpful if there are any ways to address this.","nelsens@ohsu.edu"

I would also like to respectfully suggest lecturing a little more clearly and slowly, there were times that I could not follow what was said.

Please consider allowing students to complete their thought and then respond. Because many of us are learning the material for the first time, we might not have the correct understanding -- this is why many of us ask questions. Many instructors try to put themselves in our shoes when students ask questions and say, ""that's a great question,"" even when sometimes the questions are not great questions. I think many instructors realize how stressful it can be to ask a question in front of 100+ of your incredibly competent classmates and friends and want to not appear ""silly or stupid.""

Additionally, very little time was spent discussing the pathophysiology of the drugs, instead defending the widespread use of statins for both primary and secondary prevention of MI. Finally, I was particularly taken aback by Dr. Duell's answer to the question about myopathy as a side effect. He asked the class how many had had muscle aches in the past month and most raised their hands. ""Well, there you have it,"" he said. Is this the type of logic we want to have as future clinicians?

You mentioned that the effect of smoking on CVD is likely overstated because it is so highly associated with low socio economic status. There are no studies that would be published in reputable journals that would not control for SES. You could make the argument that this confounder is not adequately controlled for, however I have not seen anything published about that in epidemiological journals. Suffice it to say: I though your point inadequately confused my fellow students. I find that my classmates are so quick to dismiss research because of what a professor says.

"This was one of my favorite lectures of the week. I felt like you tied together many very important concepts in reasonable way. There were two really great things you did - you provided us with a reasonable amount of material to cover in the time period, and you brought in current misconceptions and your clinical picture. Specifically, I appreciated how you tied in the idea of a low-salt vs a Western diet and how, contrary to popular belief, this can cause high BP in the general sense. You taught us that this is true for only 25% ish of the population and that the rest are considered salt-insensitive but that there are other health benefits to eating a low-salt diet, which may include future kidney health. The only recommendation I would make looking at the room during lecture would be a little more emphasis on the terminology of salt-sensitive vs salt-insensitive. Personally, the word sensitive has a positive connotation and such, I was expecting that a salt-sensitive person would be the ideal. The terminology is not immediately intuitive and I think that tripped some people up. Perhaps a question to check our understanding about half way  through the lecture would have been helpful. Additionally, I would do a similar check for understanding question right before combining the cardiac concepts with the newly introduced renal function curve. Otherwise, I think you did a great job!

"First session on Monday (Introduction to Renal Syndromes) was well done. Clear slides, really appreciated having arrows pointing from text to images on the slides. ","Unfortunately, the Renal Tumors session did not go well at all. However, I think it can be improved drastically relatively easily. We have had a number of phenomenal histology sessions from Dr. Schnapp which should serve as examples for other histology sessions. However, this did not follow that format. Some attributes which were not present in this session which have been immensely helpful for Schnapp's sessions are outlined here: 1) Clear identification of pre-work as being critical for participation in the session 2) High yield pre-work - the provided document was 90% text which was quite difficult to digest when the material we are going over is largely visual.  3) Introduction of material building up slowly prior to the session - the provided document dove right in and was very dense with very little build up / progression. 4) Annotations directly in slidebox - this was a HUGE improvement in Schnapp's sessions. Before they included annotations it was very difficult to figure out what was what and we had to call an instructor over every single time to double check. Annotating things in slidebox for us to view via the narrative would free the instructor up to answer true questions about the material, rather than ""I think this is a tubule but I'm not sure because it doesn't look like the google images"" questions.  5) Identification of what the session actually is. Sakai said it was a lab, but for typical labs we don't need computers (iPads will do). However, we were unprepared for the session in this regard as well.","Many students have given positive feedback regarding Dr. Schnapp's sessions.

"Clarity of the slides was outstanding, as was the organization. Really appreciated the labels with arrows pointing to histological features like on her Tubulointerstitial Fibrosis slide. She went quite fast but since the slides had these arrows and annotations already I was able to sit back and listen much more than during lectures which have less clear slides or slides which require more annotation on my part. Also really appreciated having slides in the exact same order in both our copy and her copy, and having slide numbers on both copies. I zoned out for a slide and was able to quickly reorient myself when I refocused. She presented things at a great level for our knowledge and delivered it in a very no nonsense kind of manner. Good use of the concept map early in the slide set. As far as traditional lectures are concerned, hers was pretty exemplary of what we like. While there was no form of active learning present in the session and I am certainly a proponent of in-depth and engaging clicker questions, I think that this is a perfect example of a session which was engaging and lent itself well to the traditional style. Clicker questions would have significantly disrupted her flow. ","It would have been nice to have a verbal warning that we were shifting gears between topics. For instance, she went from talking about pathology on the Tubular Proteinuria slide (23) instantly into the Screening for Proteinuria slide (24) with zero pause. It would have been helpful for her to say ""ok, now we're going to switch gears from talking about pathology to talking about screening and labs"" before launching into it so that we could reorient ourselves mentally.

"Dr Iragorri is very enthusiastic about her presentations. She makes them interesting, and brings her liveliness into the presentations. This week she presented a lecture about congenital kidney conditions. She used case studies to highlight the main points; I thought it was very interesting. The main points of the diseases was very clear.","","We did not cover 'horseshoe kidney' - I'm not sure if we should have done. It was in my Pathoma review video so it must be on the boards.","iragorri@ohsu.edu"
"Clear commitment to the concept of tbl.  ","Could we switch it up and have the TBL questions be synthesis questions from the week prior instead of going forward?  Then as a group we could gRAT, develop case questions relevant, and be ready to learn.  Having to learn a large amount of the monday material ahead of time is just not productive when the answers to the questions aren't definitive, and leads to a frustrating start to the day.","","bowenj@ohsu.edu"
"Great study guides and lectures. Truly informative and easy to read, and correlate to one another.  You are really fantastic in small group also, explaining things really clearly and from a patient/clinical perspective.","","","dirkxt@ohsu.edu"
"","There are some great ideas out there to improve and change TBL.   Now might be a chance to challenge students; moving beyond clicker questions.  Let's have the teams review the case together, come up with PR, Summary Statement, and a formal presentation; together. Have a few teams present.  I think the questions have lost their value; they have become discussions of semantics.","","bowenj@ohsu.edu"

"Always the best! Noone explains drugs as well as Dr. O I learn so much just from listening to his lectures. the pace of lectures are wonderful and the outlines are good and the expectations of what to know are always known which is very helpful. ","","","olyaeia@ohsu.edu"
"I know this wasn't your fault, but please make sure next year's students know that they absolutely must know the study guide before they come to the tumor lecture","","","troxellm@ohsu.edu"

"Dr. Iragorri is a very knowledgeable and enthusiastic professor. Her love of renal function is inspiring and motivational. She is always willing to answer questions both during and after lectures/small group sessions.  ","I would greatly appreciate concepts maps that connect everything that we are learning.  I greatly appreciate the study guides, but would benefit immensely from increased organization (and a consistent number of slides presented per hour of lecture). ","Many of my classmates have turned to outside resources, such as BRS in order to pass the various renal components.  Perhaps increased organization of overarching themes would help to ensure that students derive the maximum value from attending lectures. ","iragorri@ohsu.edu"

"","It seems like we finished a little bit behind schedule this week, which led to the morning lecturers being rushed. In reality, we only need 10 minutes to come to a consensus on our answers about the gRAT, and we can start discussion earlier if that would speed things up. ","","bowenj@ohsu.edu"
